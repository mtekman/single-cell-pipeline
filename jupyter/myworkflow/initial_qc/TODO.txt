Notes:

 - Fit a gaussian to your genes after normalisation but BEFORE gene filtering.
 - Or do a median expression analysis, stdev over all excluding outliers
 - we are looking for significant variations in a gene, so some cells will be high
   and others will be low. All other's we don't care about
   
 - Do a plotQC of his genes
 - Use GOSeq for ontology annotations in R
 - Do SC3_plot_markers of his genes
